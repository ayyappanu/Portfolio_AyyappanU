                <h3>Determining the role of microstructural topology on the mechanical performance of nacre-inspired composites using 
                  a phase-field model</h3>
                <p>Bio-inspired composites are celebrated for their remarkable strength and fracture toughness, often surpassing the properties of 
                  their constituent materials. A prime example of this inspiration is the nacre which is approximately three thousand times tougher 
                  than its components and showcases not only high toughness but also high strength. This extraordinary performance is largely attributed
                   to its intricate microstructure. However, engineered composites have faced challenges in achieving similar levels of toughness.
                    Attempts to replicate the “brick–mortar” microstructure of nacre revealed that mere imitation falls short. Recent studies emphasize
                     the critical influence of specific parameters, such as volume fraction, aspect ratio, and tablet waviness angle, on the 
                     microstructure effectiveness. Prior investigations, whether experimental, numerical, or analytical, underlined the importance of 
                     these parameters in shaping composite mechanical properties. However, many of these studies relied on commercial software with some
                      inbuilt fracture criteria, often overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating a phase-field model for a more comprehensive 
                      parametric analysis. Our research delves into the impact of these parameters on the mechanical performance of nacre-inspired 
                      composites, utilizing a phase-field model based on Griffith’s fracture criteria for complex crack propagation modeling. 
                      We notably reveal the superior performance of geometrically interlocking architecture compared to non-interlocking and 
                      rectangular architecture, marking a pioneering parametric exploration of this microstructure using a phase-field model. 
                      We validate our findings through experimental and numerical data. In summary, our work demonstrates that by strategically
                       adjusting microstructural parameters, one can achieve optimal performance enhancements in nacre-inspired engineered composites.
                        For instance, even a slight alteration of the waviness angle while maintaining constant volume fraction and aspect ratio can
                         yield a remarkable 16.23% increase in fracture energy. Our open-source finite element codes, implemented using the Julia-based 
                         Gridap package, offer a “virtual” experimental tool for designing bio-inspired composites with high toughness and reasonable
                          strength. This approach also provides valuable insights into creating exceptionally tough multilayered composites with diverse 
                          constituent combinations, holding significant promise for applications in automotive, aerospace, armor, and beyond.</p>

                  Gridap in Julia</h3>
                <p>In this paper, we propose a phase-field model for electro-mechanical fracture in brittle materials
                  and provide an
                  open-source implementation of the proposed model using a newly developed finite element (FE) toolbox,
                  Gridap in Julia.
                  Here, we have considered electric potential as an additional kinematic descriptor along with the
                  displacement and
                  phase-field variable. Using the virtual power principle, we have derived force balances for the
                  electro-mechanical
                  forces and a force balance associated with the damage. To incorporate the strong electro-mechanical
                  coupling effect into
                  the model, we have considered the Helmholtz free energy as a function of the electric field vector,
                  strain tensor,
                  phase-field variable, and the gradient of the phase-field variable. The proposed model ensures that
                  the constitutive
                  relations of the thermodynamic fluxes are on the satisfaction of the thermodynamic laws and can
                  readily accommodate
                  dissipative energy effects whenever needed. The proposed model provides complex crack paths as a
                  solution to the
                  governing partial differential equations (PDEs), and thus bypasses the need for re-meshing, enrichment
                  of FE shape
                  functions, and an explicit tracking of the crack surfaces. The use of Gridap makes the FE
                  implementation of the proposed
                  model exceedingly compact and user-friendly requiring very low memory usage and providing a high
                  degree of flexibility
                  to the users in defining weak forms of the governing PDEs. We have validated the proposed model and
                  its implementation
                  against a compact tension test on a single edge notched plate and a set of three-point bending tests
                  on a notched beam
                  made of lead zirconium titanate (PZT)-4 piezoelectric ceramics.</p>

                <h3>Combined diffused material interface and hybrid phase-field model for brittle fracture in
                  heterogeneous composites</h3>
                <p>In this article, we propose a novel approach for modeling brittle fracture in heterogeneous
                  composites using a combined
                  diffused material interface method and a hybrid phase-field model (PFM). We have used the diffused
                  material interface
                  method to derive analytical expressions for the regularized material properties across the material
                  interfaces that are
                  treated as an input to the PFM for the simulation of brittle fractures in composites. The use of
                  diffused material
                  interface method regularizes the material properties in such a way that one can avoid the
                  discontinuity in stress across
                  the material interface and thus bypass the requirement of explicit tracking of material interfaces for
                  finite element
                  implementation of the hybrid PFM. We have implemented the proposed combined model using a recently
                  developed open-source
                  finite element toolbox, Gridap in Julia. We have considered tests on a single circular fiber inclusion
                  under tension, a
                  bi-material rectangular plate under tension, single square inclusion under tensile loading, a notched
                  composite beam
                  with a central notch under symmetric three-point bending, and a rectangular plate with multiple fibers
                  under tensile
                  loading to show how the proposed combined model can be used to simulate brittle fracture in
                  composites.</p>

                <h3>A novel homogenization method for periodic piezoelectric composites via diffused material interface</h3>
                <p>In this article, we propose a novel homogenization method for piezoelectric composites with periodic microstructures.
                   In the proposed homogenization method, one can find the analytical expressions for the material properties of the composites in the
                    representative volume element (RVE) via diffused material interface method. The availability of analytical expressions for the 
                    material properties in the entire domain of the RVE enables one to determine the effective homogenized material properties with the
                     standard finite element method. As the proposed homogenization method regularizes the discontinuity in material properties across
                      the interfaces, there is no need to explicitly track the material interfaces while implementing the finite element method for 
                      determining the effective material properties. Hence, one can implement the proposed homogenized method for any piezoelectric
                       composites with complicated material interfaces and determine the effective material properties. In this study, we have 
                       considered the piezoelectric composites to be comprised of periodic microstructures where the RVE constitutes a matrix with an
                        inclusion of a specific shape. We have carried out a study on the effect of the shape of inclusion viz. square-shaped, I-shaped,
                         T-shaped, and plus-shaped, and the size of inclusion on the effective piezoelectric material properties. We have also studied

                <h3>A phase-field length scale insensitive mode-dependent fracture model for brittle failure</h3>
                <p>This article presents a consistent phase-field length scale insensitive mode-dependent fracture model
                  for brittle
                  failure by proposing mode-factor dependent degradation functions that incorporate the effect of two
                  additional fracture
                  parameters, namely the mode-II critical energy release rate and mode-II fracture strength, on the
                  overall mechanical
                  response. Using the proposed mode-factor dependent degradation functions and employing a recently
                  proposed modified
                  strain decomposition scheme, we provide analytical expressions for the mode-I and mode-II fracture
                  strengths
                  corresponding to the mode-dependent parts of the elastic energy. Adopting a modified Benzeggagh–Kenane
                  (B–K) criteria,
                  we propose mode-dependent driving forces by deriving expressions for the critical energy release rate
                  corresponding to
                  individual fracture modes. The proposed model provides a consistent coupling between the different
                  fracture modes and
                  can thus predict fracture for all possible mode-mixity ratios. A parametric study is carried out to
                  unravel the effect
                  of mixed-mode fracture parameters on the mechanical response of isotropic materials by considering a
                  few representative
                  numerical examples. The numerical results from the proposed model show an excellent agreement with
                  experimental results
                  reported in the literature.</p>

            <p>This study introduces a consistent mode-dependent phase-field model (PFM) for brittle failure under both mechanical and electro-mechanical
               loading conditions. The proposed framework will facilitate the topology optimization of smart materials, aiming to minimize structural 
               weight while enhancing fracture strength. Currently, a mode-dependent PFM for brittle fracture under mechanical loads is developed by
                proposing mode-factor dependent degradation functions that incorporate the effect of two additional fracture parameters, namely the 
                mode-II critical energy release rate and mode-II fracture strength, on the overall mechanical response. Using the proposed mode-factor 
                dependent degradation functions and employing a recently proposed modified strain decomposition scheme, analytical expressions for the 
                mode-I and mode-II fracture strengths are provided corresponding to the mode-dependent parts of the elastic energy. Mode-dependent
                 driving forces are proposed by adopting a modified Benzeggagh-Kenane (B-K) criteria and deriving expressions for the critical energy 
                 release rate corresponding to individual fracture modes. The proposed model provides a consistent coupling between the different
                  fracture modes and can thus predict fracture for all possible mode-mixity ratios. A parametric study is carried out to unravel the
                   effect of mixed-mode fracture parameters on the mechanical response of isotropic materials by considering a few representative
                    numerical examples. The numerical results from the proposed model show an excellent agreement with experimental results reported 
                    in the literature. Moreover, results have been generated for the case of fatigue failure in materials under mechanical and 
                    electro-mechanical loading conditions, which can be extended for the development of mode-dependent fracture models.
                     The fatigue effect has been characterized by introducing a degradation function that regulates the evolution of the phase 
                     field variable. The obtained results under both cyclically applied displacement and electric potential are demonstrated.

            <p>The development of high-performance bio-inspired composites is one of the contemporary topics of research interest. Experiments on 
              composites made of constituents with contrasting material properties and thus possessing a distinct material interface have shown 
              very promising results in terms of having high strength and high toughness. To the best of author's knowledge, although several analytical
               studies on the functionally graded in-homogeneous plates with material properties varying in exponential or power series manner are 
               available in the literature, there is no analytical method to find a closed-form solution for composites with a distinct material 
               interface. Because of the unavailability of analytical methods, finite element solutions are extensively used for the analysis of these
                problems. However, validation of the finite element solution for composites with material interface against benchmark problems will 
                increase the confidence. In this work, a diffused material interface-based novel method is proposed for finding analytical solutions 
                for the elastic deformation in composites with in-plane homogeneity that can be used as benchmark problems for the validation of the 
                finite element solutions. In the proposed analytical method, the material interface is diffused using a Gaussian kernel function and 
                derived expressions for the material properties that are smooth, i.e, functions and their derivatives are continuous, in the entire 
                domain. The Galerkin method is used to solve the governing partial differential equations for the derived smooth material properties. 
                The efficacy of the proposed analytical approach is demonstrated through illustrative examples on the composite bar, beam, and plates 
                with in-plate inhomogeneities. Also, a combined diffused material interface and hybrid phase-field model is proposed for 
                modeling micro-fracture evolution in heterogeneous composites. Here, analytical expressions for the regularized properties at the
                 material interface are derived from the matrix and inclusions properties by using a recently proposed diffused material interface 
                 method. To model de-bonding at the material interface or cracks in the matrix or inclusion, the phase-field model, a continuum diffused 
                 crack approach, that provides the crack path as a solution to partial differential equations is used and thus bypasses the requirement
                  of tracking individual cracks, enrichment of shape-functions or re-meshing during crack propagation. An open-source implementation of 
                  the proposed combined model is proposed using a recently developed finite element toolbox, Gridap in Julia. The proposed model and its 
                  implementation is validated against experimental results on complicated de-bonding and kinking micro-crack paths in quasi-brittle 
                  materials.</p>
